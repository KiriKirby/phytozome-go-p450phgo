# P450 PGD agent instructions

## Plant rebuild authority

- The immediate release target is the complete `plants` section from the Dr. Nelson plants page. Work through the page resources one at a time in page/manifest order.
- Current checkpoint (2026-10-09): all 59 plant resources are complete in manifest order through Red Algae. Their reviewed resource totals are 18,172 records and 18,013 literal sequences; together with 15 pre-existing CAld5H relationships, the formal PGD target is 18,187 records. The plant release gate is satisfied; non-plant resources remain disabled until independently reviewed.
- Download and inspect every plant resource independently. A resource is not approved merely because it has been Office-normalized or mentioned in an audit document.
- Do not publish plant records produced by a category-wide CYP regex scan, printable-byte scan, guessed delimiter, guessed FASTA boundary, or a generic "sequence-looking token" rule.
- Every approved plant resource must have its own parser/profile implementation or a reviewed structured CSV whose columns and row relationships were checked against that exact source file.
- Excel resources must be inspected at workbook, worksheet, header, merged-cell, hidden-row/column, and representative-row level before defining their parser. Sequence data may be accepted only from the exact reviewed sheet/column or cell layout for that workbook.
- Word/text resources must be inspected as complete logical blocks. Define the exact header, annotation, protein-sequence, terminator, fragment, pseudogene, duplicate, and foreign-species rules for that document. Never skip arbitrary intervening text to assemble a sequence.
- Preserve source row order and source provenance. Keep duplicate/alternate resources distinct unless a documented merge rule proves that two rows describe the same biological record.
- A protein sequence must be literal source data. Do not infer, repair, translate, or obtain it from another database. Preserve documented fragment/pseudogene status; remove only an explicit terminal stop marker from the stored amino-acid sequence.
- Each accepted record must keep the source URL and a resource-specific description sufficient to locate the source row/block. Empty fields remain empty.

## Review ledger and release gate

- Maintain a durable per-resource review under `docs/plants/` and a machine-readable plant completion ledger under `sources/`.
- Each completed resource records: source file and URL, source hash, worksheets/sections inspected, exact parser/profile, total accepted records, records with sequence, missing-sequence count, duplicates/alternates, fragments/pseudogenes, foreign-species rows, and unresolved issues.
- A plant species/resource is selectable only after its exact parser or reviewed CSV passes tests and its audit is marked complete. Unreviewed resources remain present but disabled.
- The formal `p450phgo.pgd` plant records must be built only from completed resource-specific inputs. The legacy generic `parseExtracted` path must not contribute publishable plant records.
- Tests must include representative first/middle/last records and every exceptional layout found in the source, plus sequence alphabet/length checks and record/sequence-count assertions.
- After every completed resource, rebuild to a temporary PGD, inspect its records, and compare its counts and representative sequences with the source before marking the resource complete.

## Runtime compatibility

- Keep the bbolt runtime fields compatible with `phytozome-go/internal/cyp`: `ID`, `Category`, `Species`, `Symbol`, `Description`, `Sequence`, and `SourceURL`, plus the existing `species` bucket contract.
- If richer source metadata is needed, evolve the schema and runtime reader together with backward-compatible tests; do not overload existing fields with ambiguous values.
- Update the main runtime repository's `AGENT.md` CYP status whenever the published plant coverage or database contract materially changes.

## Repository handling

- Existing uncommitted work may be modified; do not discard unrelated user changes.
- Raw downloads and normalized intermediates may remain ignored, but every published result must be reproducible from the manifest, resource-specific parser/profile, and documented source hash.
